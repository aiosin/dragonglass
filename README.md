# dragonglass - a lousy hastebin/pastebin clone

built on top of:
- bootstrap
- bottle - a micro-webframework written for python
- and not a single line of javascript

remarkable features:
- none to speak of yet, but the most exciting logic in this webapp is the id-generation which is a `sha1Â´-hash of the content and the current time in miliseconds
- bottles easily set up doesnt force you into any kind of decisions and bottle's routing is a pleasure to work with, it is intuitive for everyone who doesnt have a big python backround
